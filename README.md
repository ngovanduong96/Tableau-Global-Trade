# Global Trade Analysis using Tableau

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing global trade data from 1988 to 2016 across three major countries: USA, Germany, and Japan. The objective was to create innovative and interactive Tableau dashboards that provide insights into potential commodities, trade amounts, quantities, and their relationships over the specified period. Additionally, the project aimed to explore the potential impact of population dynamics on trade balances within these countries.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project was to assist the client in launching a new business unit with a focus on global trade and logistics. By leveraging Tableau's capabilities, we aimed to provide visually appealing dashboards that enable users to explore trade patterns, identify trends, and understand the dynamics of trade relationships between the selected countries.

## Dataset
The dataset provided by the client consisted of 59,090 observations of 10 variables. However, it required cleaning due to missing values and inconsistencies. The cleaning process was carried out using a combination of Excel and the R programming language, ensuring that the data was prepared for visualization in Tableau.

## Tableau Dashboards
Two interactive Tableau dashboards were developed as part of this project. These dashboards utilize a range of Tableau functions and features to provide comprehensive insights into global trade dynamics. The following functions were utilized in the creation of these dashboards:

- **Aggregation Function**: Sum and average functions were employed to aggregate trade data based on different criteria such as commodities, countries, and years.
- **Table Calculation**: Window average calculations were used to analyze trends and smooth out fluctuations in the data.
- **Logical Function**: Various logical functions such as 'if', 'elseif', and 'case' were employed to create dynamic calculations and filters.
- **Level of Detail**: Fixed level of detail calculations were utilized to maintain consistency in aggregations across different visualizations.
- **Parameter**: Parameters were incorporated to allow users to interactively filter and analyze the data based on their preferences.
- **Data Joining and Blending**: Both data joining and blending techniques were utilized to integrate multiple data sources and enrich the analysis.
- **Actions**: Interactive actions were implemented to enable drill-down capabilities and enhance user engagement with the dashboards.
